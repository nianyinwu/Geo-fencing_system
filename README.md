# Geo-fencing System

Simulate a geo-fencing system with six receivers are used to construct a virtual fence on the plane, and data returned to receivers does not follow the order of the fence.

Therefore, the this work is to sort the order of receivers, consider the first receiver that receives the return data as the origin, and output the coordinates of each receiver in the counterclockwise direction.
